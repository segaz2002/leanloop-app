# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** Beginners get a plan they can follow and weekly adjustments that keep them progressing.

## Current Focus (Today)

**Phase:** MVP build (Auth + Workouts + Progress)
**Today’s objective:** Tighten the **consistency loop** (goals + quick habit logging + clearer Progress copy) and QA iOS/web.

## Current Position

Status: Active development
Last activity: 2026-02-25 — Workout logging UX + Exercise detail + Progress scoreboard shipped.

## Blockers

- None (core stack stable). Next blockers will be:
  - exercise image pack licensing/source decision (placeholders currently)
  - subscription/IAP implementation (not started)

## Next Up (After Today)

- Home: show quest status + quick log summary (reduce tab-hopping)
- Progress: weekly recap card + gentle celebration (non-spammy)
- Subscription/paywall plan
