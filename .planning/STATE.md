# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** Beginners get a plan they can follow and weekly adjustments that keep them progressing.

## Current Focus (Today)

**Phase:** Phase 4 (Subscription + Paywall)
**Today’s objective:** Begin v1.4 planning — Subscription + Paywall (IAP, trial, paywall gating).

## Current Position

Status: Active development
Last activity: 2026-02-28 — v1.3 complete. Goal picker shipped (fat loss / maintenance / lean gain). Per-goal adjustment rules live (computeAdjustments in adjustment.logic.ts). Substitution selections now persist across sessions.

## Blockers

- None (core stack stable). Next blockers will be:
  - exercise image pack licensing/source decision (placeholders currently)
  - subscription/IAP implementation (not started — need to pick RevenueCat vs native StoreKit)

## Next Up (After Today)

Product (v1.4 / Phase 4):
- Subscription/paywall plan
- IAP implementation (RevenueCat recommended)
- Trial period + paywall gating on premium features
- App Store subscription setup
