# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** Beginners get a plan they can follow and weekly adjustments that keep them progressing.

## Current Focus (Today)

**Phase:** Phase 3 (Weekly check-in + adaptation)
**Today’s objective:** Final sweep QA complete → ship v1.1 → begin v1.2 work (weekly check-in, weight trend, target adjustment rules).

## Current Position

Status: Active development
Last activity: 2026-02-26 — v1.1 shipped + v1.2 started (weight logging, weekly check-in, goal suggestions) + UI theme system refactor underway.

## Blockers

- None (core stack stable). Next blockers will be:
  - exercise image pack licensing/source decision (placeholders currently)
  - subscription/IAP implementation (not started)

## Next Up (After Today)

Product (Phase 3 completion):
- Weight trend chart (simple, honest)
- Refine weekly adjustment rules (use weight delta + adherence; deterministic and explainable)
- Exercise substitutions (basic)

Design system:
- Finish migration of remaining screens to UI primitives (Typography/Input)
- Remove legacy hard-coded colors + unify spacing/radius

Business:
- Subscription/paywall plan
